# Privacy Attendance System

A blockchain-based confidential employee attendance management system built with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, ensuring complete privacy of employee work hours while maintaining transparent organizational oversight.

## Core Concepts

### FHE Smart Contracts
This system leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to enable computation on encrypted data without revealing the underlying information. Employee check-in and check-out times are encrypted on-chain, allowing for attendance calculations while preserving complete privacy of individual work patterns.

### Privacy-First Architecture
- **Zero-Knowledge Privacy**: Employee work hours remain encrypted at all times
- **Confidential Computations**: All attendance calculations performed on encrypted data
- **Selective Disclosure**: Only authorized parties can decrypt specific attendance records
- **Immutable Records**: Blockchain ensures tamper-proof attendance history

## Key Features

### üîê Confidential Attendance Tracking
- Encrypted check-in/check-out timestamps using FHE
- Private work hour calculations
